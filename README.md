This is our Actency Bootstrap SASS sub-theme, using by drupency install profile.
We can work here on a cool out of the box version for every new projects :)
Do not sub-theme this theme again, simply use it as is.
You can rename it for your project but be careful with hooks etc.

To help consolidate and remove possible future inconsistencies, the
documentation for this sub-theme starter kit has been moved to:
http://drupal.org/node/1978010.

sass/style.scss include boostrap and compass utilites.
If you doesn't need Bootstrap styles, you can comment import lines.

Compass utilities are very helpfull. You can find all here : http://compass-style.org/index/mixins/
